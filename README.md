# SonorousAbilities 
This is an ability plugin I have been developing for my Minecraft server.

It contains ground-breaking features for Minecraft that really push the limits of what is possible server-side.

In short, players can join a server and select an archetype (my chosen word for their class), and view a list of abilities using commands.
Players can then bind abilities to their hotbar slots which can have extremely complicated functionality - the sky really is the limit.

### Some cool pictures
